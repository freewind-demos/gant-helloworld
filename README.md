Gant Hello World
================

Install gant 
------------

Notice for now we can't install with `brew install gant` any more, instead, we have to install it manually.

Download the "1.10.0 Binary, standalone installation" file from <https://gant.github.io/Prepackaged_Distributions.html>, unpackage it, and use the `bin/gant` file.

Run:

```
gant
```
